# Project - Most Nobel Prizes Analysis

The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. In this project, I aanalyzed the characteristics of the prize winners. Which country gets it most often? Has anybody gotten it multiple times? 
And much more! 


## About the Datasets

I have used one dataset (courtesy of Datacamp and Kaggle) for the analysis.  
**‘nobel.csv’** contains a record for every individual or organization that was awarded the Nobel Prize since its inception in 1901.
